# Theoretical-and-Computational-Analysis-of-Mercury-s-Perihelion-Precession-Newton-vs-Einstein
Calculates the mercury’s perihelion precession using General Theory of Relativity which is the one of Einstein’s dramatic successes over Newtonian mechanics and visualizes the orbit computationally for both Newtonian and Einsteinian frameworks.
